I've done the following: 
1. Look at dimensions, count of missing values, failure/success proportion 
2. Map failure/OK hard drives against time --> Most of the OK drives are in Dec. That's creatign the skew. 
3. Summary of data --> This is quite useless in my opinon
4. Looked for missing values and its proportion --> about 40 columns (37%) jave > 90% missing values
5. Looked for columns with 0 variance --> Anout 11 columns have 0 variance (i.e. these columns have only 1 value) 
6. Looked for cyclical patterns when data goes missing --> Q1 & Q4 have more columns with missing data
7. Looked for correlations --> TBH I stopped here. But will pick up tomorrow morning. The "?" values in the correlation plot means that the program was trying to correlate "NA" values.
