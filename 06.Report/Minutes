9 Feb 2019 

To recap: 
1. We are using 2018 data only. We currently have Q4 2018 data. @Raj Baharat to extract the rest of year -- update where & when done. 
2. @Vignesh & @ET to define objectives and EDAs to do by Wed. Each to do own & catch up by Wed (13 Feb). 
Get consensus on objectives and EDAs; divide and conquer, then do the work
3. @Vignesh & ET to update progress by Sat 16 Feb with team. By then, we should have a sense of the models to prep and create. Decide on models to use by Sat 16 Feb. 
4. Create models (Mon 18 Feb to Sat 24 Feb). Update team. 
5. Build report (Don't know when) 

NB: @Raj Baharat Will be away from 20 Feb to 4 Mar. 
Tools: Scala (extraction) + R (EDA, modelling)
